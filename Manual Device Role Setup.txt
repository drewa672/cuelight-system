#Setting up Device role
The unified code bases what is set in the "device_role.JSON" file to determine what it will open as.

##Device role.JSON
This file determines what the device will boot as

For Transmitter you should see this:
{"role": "transmitter"}

For Receiver you should see this:
{"role": "receiver"}

if there is any error in spelling, the device will default to a receiver.
